                What started as weekend experiments in my grandmother&apos;s kitchen has grown into a 
                mission to bring you nature&apos;s purest gifts. Armed with her century-old recipes 
                and a passion for natural beauty, I began Kusum Creations in 2020.

                Every bar of soap, every blend of oils, every ingredient is carefully chosen and 
                lovingly crafted by hand. I believe that skincare should be simple, pure, and 
                effective - just like the remedies our grandmothers trusted.
